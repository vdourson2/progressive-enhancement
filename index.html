        <h2>The story</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
                around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                unfortunate.” The farmer said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven
                wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a
                great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” </p>
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
                his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,” and the farmer
                responded,
                “<strong>Maybe</strong>.” The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into
                the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and
                said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, “<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</p>
            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
                tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span
                    class="bad">bad</span> — because you never
                know what will be the
                consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span
                    class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>
